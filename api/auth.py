"""
Ticket-based auth for the language-eval control API (self.language-eval /
self.ai#25).

self.ai mints short-lived, scoped JWTs before calling into this control
plane (self.ai#25's proposal: self.ai is the yard's internal ticket-granting
service). This module is the validating side, ported directly from
self.llamolotl's api/auth.py (self.llamolotl#12, the first backend wired to
this pattern, merged self.ai!77 + self.llamolotl!13, 2026-07-09) — same JWT
verification, same fail-closed-if-unconfigured behavior, same
SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET/SERVICE_AUTH_AUDIENCE env convention so this service can
share the existing selfai-service-auth secret. Every mutating/control
endpoint on :8096 requires a valid ticket in the `X-Selfai-Ticket` header —
signature, audience, expiry, and scope are all checked.

This is self.language-eval's leg of the rollout described in
context/kits/cavekit-service-mesh-ticket-auth.md (self.ai repo) — R3 names
self.code-eval/self.language-eval as the last (fourth) leg, after
self.llamolotl, self.curator, and the self.transcribe/self.speak pair,
because job-creation inputs here are already sanitized against injection
(_validate_id/_sanitize_string/_sanitize_value/_sanitize_log_line already
guard the subprocess/log layer) — the marginal severity reduction from
ticket auth is real (anyone with network reach can submit/cancel jobs today)
but smaller than self.curator's raw-code-at-rest surface. Identical taxonomy
and route shape to self.code-eval's api/auth.py by design — the two services
are near-identical codebases (self.ai#25's own kit calls this out) and
should not be allowed to drift.

Scope taxonomy (mirror of self.ai's minting side in
api/selfai_ui/routers/evaluations.py — keep both lists in sync):
  tasks:read  - list available benchmark tasks/categories
  jobs:read   - list/get jobs, job logs, job live-stream, results, result
                samples (results are keyed by job — same grouping
                convention self.llamolotl and self.curator use for job
                outputs, not a separate scope)
  jobs:create - start a new evaluation job
  jobs:write  - cancel/purge a job

NetworkPolicy-level pod-to-pod restriction is a complementary defense-in-
depth layer, explicitly out of scope here (see self.llamolotl#12's own
docstring — same posture carried forward).
